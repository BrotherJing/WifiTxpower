## Wifi TxPower
this app can adjust your phone's wifi txpower higher to get stronger wifi signal or lower to save battery.

to make this run, please make sure:
- your phone is rooted
- iwconfig is installed in /system/xbin or /system/bin

note that some devices might not support dynamic txpower adjustment

## Wifi Sniffer
I also add a feature of sniffing wifi network. Push ```pcap``` to your ```/system/xbin``` directory to see it work.
